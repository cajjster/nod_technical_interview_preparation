    "A Python notebook (file ending with `.ipynb`) is an interactive environment used to **write**, **run** and, **explain** code in one place, which makes it ideal for the purpose of learning Python. A notebook is divided into section called **cells**. You can think of cells as building blocks, they are small, editable units that you can run independently. There are two types of cells, **code cells** and **markdown cells**. Code cells contains code that you can execute. When you run a code sell, the notebook sends the code to the Python Interpreter, execute it and, shows you the output right below the cell. The cell you are reading this text from is a Markdown cell and we use them mainly for formatted text and explanaintions. \n",
